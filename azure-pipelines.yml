# Starter pipeline
# Start with a minimal pipeline that you can customize to build and deploy your code.
# Add steps that build, run tests, deploy, and more:
# https://aka.ms/yaml

trigger:
  branches:
    include:
      - dev   # Pipeline triggers on dev branch push

pool:
  name: Default   # Use your Windows agent pool

steps:
  - checkout: self
    persistCredentials: true  # Keep credentials so the pipeline can push

  - task: PowerShell@2
    displayName: Merge dev into main
    inputs:
      targetType: inline
      script: |
        # Set Git user for merge commit
        git config user.name "Arpan Rai"
        git config user.email "arpankumarrai007@gmail.com"

        # Fetch all branches
        git fetch origin

        # Checkout main branch
        git checkout main

        # Merge dev into main automatically
        git merge origin/dev --no-ff -m "Automated merge of dev into main"
